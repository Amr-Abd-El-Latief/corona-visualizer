# Development (project ) musts: 

 1 - we use only Angular Ionic 
 
 2 - we use only MIT licenced libraries

# App structure
   the app is organized in simple structure 
     currently 
     
       we have one main module : home module
        and we add each component for specific job ( like table view -> table component, world map -> world map component )
        to reduce the interference between developers
        you can pick some module and work on it 

     App structure 
     
         Home Module 
             \
             \-> about component
             \
             \ -> table component
             \
             \ -> chart component
             \
             \ -> world map module (to be done)
            


#  (Road MAp) next steps which you can work on :

1 - about page

2 - world map page 

3- today data : 
    a module to show the corona data of today 
    
      find an open APi which gets the today data , and make this component to to show this APi data
      The api is : https://coronavirus-19-api.herokuapp.com/countries
      
4 - time Series (by day ) Data visualizer
